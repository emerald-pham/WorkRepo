Done

- Pulled waterproof boxes for BWSS. They are robust, waterproof, but also, unfortunately, heavy, and transparent. However, they should keep water from pooling inside.
    - To prevent overheating, I may cover the inside transparent surface with water?
    - Since there are screw holes on the side, the A1 for Ski for the day, Erik, suggested that with how hardy and heavy these are, it may be nice to install them permanently instead of lugging them up and down the stairs on a regular basis.

- Began updating P-107-1 documentation regarding power. Did not complete in time, as had a series of code white calls happen in the evening.
- John and I checked that the ethernet line in south stadium has PoE, we confirmed that it did by plugging in the GPIO.
- We also pulled a battery and SBC220 but no idea where those went, somehow. Oh well.
- Firehouse rescue -
