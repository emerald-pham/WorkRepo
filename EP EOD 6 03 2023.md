- Prepared four microphones for Hotel, walked performers and some techs thru setup
- Rung out mic 2 in space with Gavin, couldn’t get a narrow Q. Ended up with the following band. Would really like to get a  narrower Q, but we weren’t able to get it any narrower. Dynamics untouched.

- Show 3, victoria on Mic 2 was completely inaudible. Not able to adjust due to the  the cue heavy show, I jogged back to the office  and reverted back to the last settings we had and grabbed an iPad. Returning to the venue, despite reverting, audio was inaudible. We were able to realize after the fact that it all stemmed from mic placement, as the mic had slipped severely.
- Set a -12.8 dB notch in every preset on Hotel side.
