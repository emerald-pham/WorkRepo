# Done

- Fixed microphone slipping. Hotel actors sometimes found medical tape uncomfortable. I advised SM and tech to sanitize and possibly replace the tape regularly.
- Installed OEM power cable ZEDi
- Completed sample rate conversion to 48k
- Submitted service request bad lighting in 4D.
- Fixed Pizza guy. Discovered only 5-6 speakers work out of 16 on two amps, not to mention amp thatâ€™s been out for years.
