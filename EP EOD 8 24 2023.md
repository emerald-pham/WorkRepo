# Done

- Transcribed VOs
- Wired up ZEDI
- Tested Peppa Mic pack. Worked fine in lakehouse, got error 8 with ALL Peppa batteries. Works fine with lakehouse batteries. Whaaaa - bad pack, or time for reconditioning? No error on other packs. Technically functional but I pulled it from Peppa to avoid confusion. Gave minor note to Austin.
- Delegated getting a new QLXD1 to Ben. I need to check if he gets the chance to do so tonight.
- Configured crossover. It is crispy in a good way!
- Attempted brief integrity check with VIM. PSM900 just died lol. For no apparent reason wouldn’t take power. I red tagged it and hackjob pulled the backup PSM900 from LCS as we’re out of PSM900s, shed single tear emoji. Pulled LCS PSM900 backup to VIM, hooked up. Still need to determine which antenna is good. Theoretically ready to go but very messy rack, sigh. I will clean it up!
