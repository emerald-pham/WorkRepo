# Done

- Bypassed dBX units at Peppa. Did not uninstall.
- Set static filters for notched feedback controller, QSys. Set at a threshold of -30. Both channels have 3/4 filters, at the same frequencies, so I'm pretty confident that it's correct. I changed the dynamic filter reclaim time from 30s to 15s, due to a lot of false positives for feedback due to loud performers around the same volume range as potential feedback. Seems to be tuned well. Previously the threshold for dynamic filters was -30, changed to -26 to reduce chances of false positives. Some of the performers can be VERY dynamic.
