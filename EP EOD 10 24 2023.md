# Done

- Setup, ran, and striked beach retreat event
- Attempted to heat shrink bwss. Couldnâ€™t find the right gauge, so removed the stuff I applied and did an integrity test.
- Asked to come by Peppa and check out the audio. It sounded atrocious, even completely flat. That venue needs a little TLC, or I need to see why the current mics sound so bad.
