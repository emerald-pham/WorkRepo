Done

- Got hotel mics up to a decent functioning standard at present, by adhering 3M Transpore onto their surface. If this is to become a longer term fix, transition to a tape that has similar properties but is colored black would be ideal.

This is strictly for personal reference, Iâ€™m not going to send this out.
