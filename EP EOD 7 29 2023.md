Done

- Updated downstairs Hotel ULXD Firmware
- Updated Duplo Schoolhouse Body Pack and Receiver Firmware
- Updated a pack from J50 to J50A for FCC Compliance
- Switched handhelds at LCS off of High Density mode, ensured frequencies (still) matched coordination
- Fixed spare transmitter frequency at LCS. I had forgotten to push it with the coordination. Never used, but nevertheless good to notice.
- Added etape to Hotel as experiment. If approved, will upgrade to heat shrink tomorrow.
- Handed off restarting Market Circle Amplifier to PM crew

Note

There is a very weird RF issue - it’s not really an issue, as noone has noticed. But regardless of whatever channel the receiver is on at Duplo Schoolhouse, channel 1 is getting two bars of RF. Which seems to me like interference from somewhere along the run, or in the rack. I’m not going to fix it with so many higher priority things to do, but on my radar. I might bring a laptop down and run a quick scan to see what it is picking up.
