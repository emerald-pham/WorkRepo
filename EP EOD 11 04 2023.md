# Done

- Added ULXD Handhelds to Kingdoms, prelim synced to current config on receiver, RF coordination needs to be updated for holidays.
- Briefly redlined Kingdoms FoF Elevation
- Equipment installed into Market Circle, minus speakeon hookup, xlr to phoenix, and Dante check. Assigned ip address to device, didn't get a chance to see if it showed up on controller or not.
