# Done

- Wired up subwoofer for Jingle Bricks
- Basic tested packs with receivers. Despite wrong antenna, signal was actually pretty great. All microphones have basic integrity, couldn't listen to them tonight but should all work together, especially once I roll out the coordination.
- "Finished" up Market Circle innards for tonight.
- Striked rescue academy temp speaker.
- Assisted with BoB and Ninjago Work
- Red Tagged Park
