**Progress Report**

**Done**

- **Compressor settings were bad, taught Caleb refresher on Dynamics and introed Joshua, reexplained everything from basics and covered a lot, minus EQ due to lacking time. Realized I had missed a lot of basics, like how dB works (0 being louder than -25, etcetera) Was mostly a dynamics issue as opposed to a compression issue, SM and Tech reported show sounded much better than first show.**
- **ClearComm packs are (apparently) designed to be latched on for both channels, or only operate on one channel at a time while the rack is in two channel mode. Could experiment, but that’s what the technician seemed to note when I called in.**
- **Mic packs, IEC, and two countrymans delivered to 4D, (one for DD, one as additional spare), charger hooked up, all mics synced, all mics labeled with gaff tape with number and designation.**
- **Ninjago meet and greet music setup with 15 minute loop pulled from core.**
- **Receiver Combiner pulled from LCS booth to Lakehouse. No transmitter combiner located in Lakehouse upon cursory search by Tony and I.**
- **Existing Antenna combiner in LCS was confirmed to be designed for receivers, as opposed to transmitters when glancing thru manual.**
- **Peppa BoM - ish.**
- **Wall hook for blower unit installed inside LCS booth.**

**Remaining Todo**

- **Incorrect receiver combiner was pulled from LCS to Lakehouse.**
- **Pull / test windscreens for 4D mics from HLH.**
- **Pull Rex’s mic from 4D storage to Booth.**
- **Test all mics in 4D.**
- **Complete Peppa ER Rack Elevation**

**Questions**

- **Would you like a SOP typed up for everything you had walked me thru yesterday?**
- **Do we need to Freq 4D? Looks like all the frequencies were set manually as opposed to doing a scan?**
