Done

- Commissioned microphones for Andrew LCS, using the microphone for Ben. Slightly tweaked EQ, lowered 500Hz by about 3 dB to reduce resonance. Didn’t address resonance of microphone within the venue as house was about to open. Lowered threshold of compressor by 1 dB and adjusted knee from 2 to 1.
- Pulled pouch at LCS for Andrew / Ben’s microphone.
- Got door of Lakehouse fixed.
- Asked ChatGPT for sanity check regarding wattage of amp, apparently should be fine with 1800W PDU.
- Finished paperwork for P-107-1.
- Pulled P-107-2 model numbers from in park rack
- Finished paperwork for P-107-2. Since it’s so far out, I’ve left the ambiguous, Q-SYS stuff unlabeled. I will clean up closer to the event date, but it’s pretty much done, shrug.

Todo Priority

- Physical Work P-107-1
- Physical Work P-107-2

Questions

- What needs to be redlined at LCS? Would you like me to handle elements of that seeing that P-107 is wrapping up well, knock on wood?
