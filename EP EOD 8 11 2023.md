# Done
- Striked headsets from 612 desk to Lakehouse
- Pushed new coordination to 4D
- Upgraded 4D Receiver Firmware
- Began process of striking intercom equipment from 4D, it is gone from 4D but somehow ended up wildly scattered throughout the park.
- Discovered we may have 6 US212 subwoofers in the park, per a schematic. Might be wildly wrong, but in the worst case scenario BGM quality is restored to Fun Town Factory area / opening. We should chat about this tomorrow morning.
- Facilitated delivery of tons and tons of QSC 8K8s to Lakehouse. Just a lot, a lot of 8K8s delivered to lakehouse. Not organized, verbally allowed it to be delegated to other team members as of present.
- With your approval tomorrow, going to take a QSC 4 channel amp some team members had mentioned and install it in Rescue Academy, once I get confirmation from you and with eyes on myself to ensure it's not like a PLD we're planning to use for a show. Low priority - they have four channels. Two output mic audio, two output television audio. One of the television audio feeds is currently down.
