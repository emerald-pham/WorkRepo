# Done

- Install NWare onto Surface
- Fixed volume knob radio
- Red tagged 10-7 Radio
- Configured router, handed off to Caleb for installation. (Ran out of time, it started raining.) WiFi signal for SoS stage is terrible, unless the SM stands right next to the performers parallel to the router.
- Pulled props for LCS.
