Done

- Mics at LCS
    - As you will have heard me mention at 1400, When I arrived with a mic for Ben, mic check was already done. I was very confused until I read [EP EOD 6/11/2023](EP%20EOD%206%2011%202023%20e7386d8d24af42c0b2ceba80227e010b.md) again and realized when I commissioned Andrewâ€™s mic, we used the microphone that had been pulled for Ben. So, I asked to verify the eq for Ben with the mic he was currently wearing, and left the mic I brought as a spare in case Ben and Andrew ever performed at once. I touched the eq a smodge but didnâ€™t adjust more than a db after sweeping and verifying the existing eq worked fine.
- Pulled to pull Pyro at ski.
- Installed antenna P-107-1

- Pulled proper transformer for P-107-2
- Mics pulled

In progress

- Doing test move of Trello todos to Notion to have everything in one place. And then I can also easily link to todos from my EOD in trello! Plus a bunch of other cool stuff. Low priority, but itâ€™ll help me feel more on top of things ðŸ˜Ž
