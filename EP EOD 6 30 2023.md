Done

- Assisted in setup and first run of South Stadium wet tech, and misc troubleshooting of issues related to attempting to get audio to South Stadium. Mostly a day of staring at QSys and struggling to try and get the I/O (and then a Dante AVIO) online, only to realize that it was likely due to a bad ethernet cable, or something indiscernible from the outgoing 610?
- Partially setup QLab file for Fireworks show, remainder of work left to be completed the next day.

Missing full notes, briefly summarized.
