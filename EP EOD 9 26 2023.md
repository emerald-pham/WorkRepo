# Done

- Added white, opaque vinyl covering to current waterproof boxes at BWSS. Since it is opaque Vinyl, it should be able to keep the light from entering the boxes better and make it cooler - but I guess we’ll see after the show reports come in. The boxes at BWSS for mics are falling apart and are being held together with tape, so either way - the boxes we just ordered will be very useful!
- Final coordination hung up in Headend. Fixed various misc errors and mistakes. Did not email to avoid excessive email spam.
- Removed all G6 band stuff from coordination, our park doesn’t use it. Note - G7 band is very congested at our park…
