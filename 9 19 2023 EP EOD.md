# Done

- Uploaded and QLab patched 7 channel wav file. Checked that all went to correct channels, did not monitor Yamaha feeds to verify that the correct content was coming thru, just following instructions. May attempt an integrity check later.
- Measured South Stadium post height, and other dimensions.
- Fixed BWSS audio switch over issue.
