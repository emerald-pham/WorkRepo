# Done

- Brought Peppa New transmitter pack
- Identified which RF line lead to the IEM transmitter antenna
- Fixed spare mic overheating issue at BWSS - microphones were overheating due to the glass tops of the boxes creating a greenhouse effect. Ashton and I added a piece of white paper to the tops to reflect light and keep the spare microphones from becoming hot to the touch.
- Secured 4 Channel ULXD4 in 4D theatre with rack screws.
- Finished installation of equipment on my end for Kingdoms ER for Very Important Monster
- Pulled Stream Deck from 4D to Kingdoms ER
