- Brought lightning charger to Parade, hooked up to lighting to ethernet
- integrity checked miniland with configured amp, except microphones - sounds great! Both runs work with amp. Sounds better with AdS8T box config?
- Setup and striked 4D special event attractions simple tech requirements. Just projector and mic.
- Adjusted Peppa AFS live lift to 45s. Adjusted bandwidth of live filters from speech to music. Fixed filters (on music mode) unchanged.
