# Done

- replaced rack ears LCS PSM900
- Finalized of costume parade, I had forgotten the packs - I’ll add them, then I’ll close the issue. Couldn’t find short rf jumper, only two twenty foot lengths - wouldn’t mind critique on whether it’ll work fine. Will start on redlining next shift. Could the patch panel use a power component?
- Headed home early tonight one hour.
