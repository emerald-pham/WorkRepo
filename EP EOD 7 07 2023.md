Done

- Removed equipment and stored cables from North and South 4th of July Racks located in Lakehouse.
- Reterminated backstage stage left monitor speaker cable, it was busted due to being stepped on too much, had sufficient slack to not require us to splice in more cable
- Rung out Benwah’s mic successfully, LCS probably spelled differently. Was easy to ring out. Attempted to do the same for Andrew, wasn’t able to nail down to problem frequencies, tasked Max with seeing which one sounded better in show at the 4 PM ish performance.

Note

- Backstage right speaker is getting a smodge quiet. (per max.) I wonder why… I also heard the same issue.
