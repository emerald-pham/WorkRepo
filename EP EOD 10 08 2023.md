# Done

- Fixed monitor "cue interruption" not included in BWSS default scene, for some reason, causing the monitors to mirror the main LR regardless of what is cued up. Cue interruption, and both cue / monitor output need to be enabled, with no source selected on monitor, for monitor to work. Kind of nonsensical but I've wrapped my head around the signal flow now.
- BWSS fireworks facilitated. Underestimated how tall I needed my help to be - James was the only one tall enough to really help.
- Reported show quality issue to James at 4D theater, related to human error w/ Usher team
- Read manual for BMP 41
- Met with James to discuss inconsistencies in Pyrotechnics SOPs and pitched foundations to have greater consistency in Pyrotechnics teams.
- Finished reading health safety and security 002 assigned by HHS team.
- Jody notes his team can help find the dimensions of the TV, they also want it to be the correct dimension.
