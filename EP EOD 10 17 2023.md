# Done

- Could not track down any Tempest packs at first glance where they used to live on the red tag shelf. I'll have to ask Tony if he knows what happened to them...
- Submitted work order for door at LCS - sticky lock
- Pulled prop mic candidates for Stephanie, left on your desk, labeled. Mostly wired, didn't pull wireless. In retrospect, should have pulled more wireless!
- Pasted instructions into booth explaining how to reset the board if I forget to reset it after fireworks, and how to fix the monitors if the monitors don't work.
- RMA'ed products put in James' office with appropriate sticky note labels.
- Updated BWSS Track sheet.
- All lakehouse transformers sorted, thanks to Jasper!
- Moved receiver downstairs at 4D, didn't bring along / download paperwork, so just left it there out of view.
- Created 5.1 scene at 4D, did a quick integrity check. Works great. Sounds decent but odd from our mix position. Also saved a non 5.1 townhall scene.
