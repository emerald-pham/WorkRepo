Done

- Flashed firmware spares LCS
- Replaced ULXD 4 channel receiver J50 with ULXD 2 Channel G50, also swapped packs and did an integrity check of audio into Qsys. Had to repatch the device in dante, left at 2230 ðŸ˜°
    - Didnâ€™t have time to strike the 4 Channel Receiver or two J50 packs. I left it in the Hotel ER and I plan to strike it Tuesday after rolling out parkwide frequency coordination.
    - Audio does indeed go from mic packs into Qsys so all good. Would feel better with a confidence check by Hotel techs!
