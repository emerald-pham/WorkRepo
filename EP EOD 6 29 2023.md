- Installed K12 Covers and Power / Cabling South Stadium and DJ Dance Party
- Built and installed Grass Line Amp with four conductor dual speakeon run, and transported two cable covers.
- Did Integrity Test for grass line amp and sub - Successful. However, speakers up top constantly receive full range signal. Might need to be addressed in QSys?
- Pulled transformer for shure handheld charger.
- South Stadium I/O unit partially installed, left overnight powered on inside door. Still needs one more speakeon to XLR from I/O unit. Figured out signal flow.
- Striked South
- Striked North
- Insufficient time to fully strike, delegated most of South closing to Connor
