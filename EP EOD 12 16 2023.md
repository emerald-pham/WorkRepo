# Done

- Setup wireless workbench on downstairs computer, configured Shure control IP address. The downstairs Mac with WWB can see the Shure receiver unit upstairs if the WiFi is disabled on it downstairsâ€¦
- Striked cable ramps placed outside of Ninjago pulled due to bad contractor placement
- Assisted with operator error issues at 4D Theatre, stuck around to watch show for audio issues after diagnosing issues
- Pulled a new pack from Lakehouse, a new durables from the office. Could not easily replicate audio dropout issue on duraplex (but was most likely culprit for audio dropouts that day) but the new pack we pulled from Lakehouse was 100 percent not good - great RF, no audio signal whatsoever.
