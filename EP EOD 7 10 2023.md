# EP EOD 7/10/2023

Created time: July 10, 2023 6:11 AM

Done

- Backed up LCS, 4D, and BWSS Yamaha board files
- Troubleshooted feedback issue at TTL - was extremely minor, came  back during second show to advise on light riding of faders to reduce feedback if it reoccurs
- Striked the conduit from BWSS to Lakehouse
- Forgot to reset TTL to default after  adjustments due to chaotic night, had  eased off on lpf, turned on hph, light compressor and gain adjustments - I did NOT save presets so I assume it’ll get overwritten anyways, just wanted to let you know 🤷‍♀️

Issues discovered and unresolved

- BWSS show file audio levels are messed up for certain tracks, especially to grass line (?) - !!
- Lakeside amp is dying - not a network issue seemingly but the amp randomly per cycles and reinitializes, causing regular bgm outages 🤦‍♀️ will report to 610 soon
