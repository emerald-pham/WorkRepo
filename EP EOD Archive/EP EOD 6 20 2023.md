Done

- Pulled batteries for P-107-1
- Installed Battery bay inside P-107-1
- Paired P-107-1, set prelim frequency
- Moved K12s and Subwoofer into staging position
- RTFM’ed spk-101, found out that you can set a  high pass at 100hz by setting the notch on the back to ext sub mode, or whatever the top switch label mode is called.
- Integrity Test P-107-1, prelim. Crossover not configured correctly, apparently.
- Inputs bridged on P-107-1 amplifier.
- Located what is assumed to be redlined LCS documentation, returned to 612’s desktop.
- Attempted to tighten LCS venue antenna, decided against it and decided to zip tie it as it seemed considerably easier. There was no visible bolt to tighten. Apparently you could add more washers?
- Removed incorrect RF combiner and jumper cables from LCS booth.
- Cleaned BWSS booth of a great degree of Rat Feces
- Returned RF Combiner to Lakehouse
