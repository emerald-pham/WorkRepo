# Done
- Troubleshot pirate island hotel lights. Replay unit was funny.
- Pulled serial to usb adapter, thanks to Tony
- Backed up Coast Guard Academy, and Headend audio with Surface Pro, pending upload to network drive.
- Delivered 10-7 packs to 612's desk. Tony reported no joy when attempting to troubleshoot them - his wordage, was that they were too old for him to even attempt a repair. Our issues with them were primarily the memory not retaining the base station iirc?
- Added labels to new handcarts
- Did a shootout between dBx at Peppa with Surface. Tone at Peppa sounded terrible when I had stopped by recently, even with a completely flat EQ. With the notch filter on channel 1 bypassed, the dBx seemingly was able to do its job with only 5 fixed filters, as opposed to the greater amount required when two systems were active at once. Notch feedback filter on QSys would work better (alone) potentially if we were to have it later in the signal chain, closer to the amplifier as per recommended, perhaps? Channel 2 still has the notch filter enabled as we did not have enough time to fully ring it out. Sounded a lot clearer with only one system in effect at once. Wait and see.
- Confirmed TV frame diagonal width for AOHC to be 48", closest tv is 46" in lakehouse, but 10-7. Continuing to search for a TV. Lots of 55" and 42", but 48" range is sparse.
- Added additional info to BWSS regarding looking up actors on UKG
