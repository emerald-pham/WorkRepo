Drawings

Print out the drawings after Joseph Albano has finished looking over them.

Market Circle

Amp already in network

Run line from subwoofer to amplifier

Confirm that the lines are run properly to the speakers - very easy to reference the drawings and see what is meant.

One home run on either side. Four speakers in total.

One speaker, throughputs to the speaker next to it.

Using channel a for left side

Channel b for right side.

Reference drawings for greater detail.

See how they’re wired up - while Ashton and X takes care of subwoofer.

Wired up with NL4 Speakeon

Plus one and minus one

Just input and throughput.

Speaker to bare end / euroblock

Not clear what time Joe will have stage done - he’ll be in at 7 ish.

If stage not dropped tonight, get lines connected to amplifier

Figure out which is left and right - get them wired up

Get subwoofer line - wrap it up - connect it to amplifier - then leave wiring in the box.

Convert to throughput if Y split may exist.

Unless it is already like that.

In the meantime, handle work that was not completed last night.
