# Done

- Worked on finale file for show music combos TVMM
- Confirmed Legoland Olympics stuff is ready for two weeks from now
- Moved coax from DreamZZZ to 4D
- Moved Cat5e from Lakehouse to 4D, prepping to run and terminate
- Determined I pulled a 10-7 tv, it likely is not the one we are looking for so I will need to find the dimensions of the tv we need, via the picture frame surrounding the TV per the documents from last year. We don't have dimensions from last year's docs, only pictures. Not great.
- Added 4 x 25 lbs to truss over at Pirates' Cove. Scary stuff.
