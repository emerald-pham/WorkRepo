AP 5122 for VIM and Zombie Cheer

Two that have mounts, two without mounts

mounting piece 270 - getting it at a quick rate is not going to happen. We need to find SOMETHING. Search lakehouse to try and find good enough mounts. Perhaps search the shop.

threads are x compatible, can be chained to the truss - perhaps not ideal solution.

Yoke - takes two cheeseboroughs - so makes it truss compatible

Check that threads is compatible or not.

I will get an allen wrench set, and then take the screw out - then try the m10 -

Remove the stuff out there.

Two speakers with mount goes to zombie cheerleader

mounting is easier in VIM due to the shorter truss.

Rigging demonstration will be shown later - jackals, chains, etcetera will be used.

Sub dropped

Tomorrow night

dropping stage first thing - extra hands will be here tomorrow night, first day is tomorrow

I'll get caught up with who I will get from the crew - we'll have Iyana to work with. We'll see how they work.

Tomorrow night - once the stage is dropped / done.

When they get in at 7 PM, we can get a QSC 18 inch underneath - GPW18 inch, used for fireworks previously. Two in Lakehouse, stacked sideways in speaker room.

# Jammin' Jacks Market Circle

Once stage is dropped, move low rise subwoofer to fit underneath the stage

Run two conductor wire to the amplifier.

Use Channel C

A will be left, B will be right

Patch Bay - priority for today.

We'll have design documents, no labelling for this show.

This shouldn't need to get labeled, except for Miniland - but there will be a patch bay.

Take a look at the wiring while we're out there. We'll have to adjust it so that there's a home run to left and right.
