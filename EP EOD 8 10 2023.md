# Done

- Migrated from Trello and Notion to GitHub - allows me to have my EOD reports and todo list underneath one roof, like I hoped Notion would be (but was not)
  - Still figuring it out, so it'll look a little messy if you look at my profile. The link I did send you should be pretty easy to navigate, let me know if it is not... 
- Completed a great deal of work on the coordination! Still needs a step or two to be completed. See https://github.com/emerald-pham/WirelessWorkbenchLLF
